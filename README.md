## What is AgentBuilder and Dialogflow?

Agent Builder is a tool on the Google Cloud platform that helps us to build an application with the coding stuff and a pinch of LLMs and on the other hand, Dialogflow is a a platform where we can design our application. Yes, even implementation is as simple as that.

I built **fitnessGroot**, it is an AI-powered chatbot developed using a Google AI agent with a large language model such as Gemini 1.0 pro on the Google Cloud Platform 🌐. It provides personalized fitness information, including workout recommendations 🏋️‍♂️, meal plans 🍽️ as per the prompt.
